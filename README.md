# Build Guide for Atreus62

## Sourcing components

- Buy PCB and electronics from [Profet Keyboards](http://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/atreus62-pcb)
- Cut case from [Ponoko Walnut 3.5mm](https://www.ponoko.com/make-and-sell/show-material/598-premium-veneer-mdf-walnut#main-image) and [Birch 3.2mm](https://www.ponoko.com/make-and-sell/show-material/358-plywood-birch#main-image) for striped pattern
- Keyswitches?
- Keycaps?

## Making Case

Thinking to create walnut top, bottom, and middle and then lighter spacing layers (birch for cheapness?). Not even sure if contrast will be too visible with laser cut burns. It being plywood or mdf, how easy can I actually sand it? I think we need three spacing layers if done with thinner wood layers. Original case in acrylic is made with [one switch plate at 4.5mm thick, one spacer layer at 4.5mm thick, one 3mm spacer layer - for a total of 12mm under the keyswitch](https://github.com/profet23/atreus62/issues/1)

Keyswitch alone will take up 8.3mm under its crown. Or 3.8mm under the original switchplate.

Teensy is maybe around 6mm thick? Anyway, we need around 12mm under the keyswitch crown it seems (not sure how much extra space left between teensy and bottom plate in original acrylic case...) 

So we need a top plate (walnut), switch plate (walnut 3.5mm), spacer (birch 3.2mm), spacer (walnut 3.5mm), spacer (birch 3.2mm), bottom (walnut) for a total of 13.4mm of usable space under the switch crown.
